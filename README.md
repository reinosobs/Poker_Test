When you have your new hand of cards, you can decide if you want to bet, to check or to hold. 

 -If you decide to check, the crupier show you his cards and nobody lose chips. 
 -If you decide to hold, the turn is finish and the crupier deal again new cards with a new deck.
 -If you decide to bet, you have to write the chips which you want to bet. The crupier will show you his cards and there will be a winner who get the pot.
